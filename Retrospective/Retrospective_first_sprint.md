## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done:  4 / 4
- Total points committed vs. done: 65 / 65
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 72 / 75:15

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing 
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

We did not consider the time needed to learn external API we used (for example to upload the map of an hike) and other technologies; Also, the time we took to fix the bugs was something which we did not expect

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

Positive: keep it simple stupid (KISS)   
Negative: We have to be more swift in our communication

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

It is the first sprint
  

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

We have to improve the estimation, considering all the details of our tasks; we have to divide the work more efficiently; Improvement is required in the management of the timesheet

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

We have implemented all the user stories planned
The team has a positive mental attitude
